	affiliation = {A significant portion of DNA consists of repeating patterns of
various sizes, from very small (one, two and three nucleotides) to very large
(over 300 nucleotides). Although the functions of these repeating regions are
not well understood, they appear important for understanding the expression,
regulation and evolution of DNA. For example, increases in the number of
trinucleotide repeats have been associated with human genetic disease, including
Fragile-X mental retardation and Huntington's disease. Repeats are also useful
as a tool in mapping and identifying DNA; the number of copies of a particular
pattern at a site is often variable among individuals (polymorphic) and is
therefore helpful in locating genes via linkage studies and also in providing
DNA fingerprints of individuals. The number of repeating regions is unknown as
is the distribution of pattern sizes. It would be useful to search for such
regions in the DNA database in order that they may be studied more fully. The
DNA database currently consists of approximately 150 million basepairs and is
growing exponentially. Therefore, any program to look for repeats must be
efficient and fast. In this paper, we present some new techniques that are
useful in recognizing repeating patterns and describe a new program for rapidly
detecting repeat regions in the DNA database where the basic unit of the repeat
has size up to 32 nucleotides. It is our hope that the examples in this paper
will illustrate the unrealized diversity of repeats in DNA and that the program
we have developed will be a useful tool for locating new and interesting
repeats.},

	abstract = {A perfect single tandem repeat is defined as a nonempty string
that can be divided into two identical substrings, e.g., abcabc. An approximate
single tandem repeat is one in which the substrings are similar, but not
identical, e.g., abcdaacd. In this paper we consider two criterions of
similarity: the Hamming distance (k mismatches) and the edit distance (k
differences). For a string S of length n and an integer k our algorithm reports
all locally optimal approximate repeats, r = umacro u, for which the Hamming
distance of umacro and u is at most k, in O(nk log (n/k)) time, or all those for
which the edit distance of umacro and u is at most k, in O(nk log k log (n/k))
time. This paper concentrates on a more general type of repeat called multiple
tandem repeats. A multiple tandem repeat in a sequence S is a (periodic)
substring r of S of the form r = u(a)u', where u is a prefix of r and u' is a
prefix of u. An approximate multiple tandem repeat is a multiple repeat with
errors; the repeated subsequences are similar but not identical. We precisely
define approximate multiple repeats, and present an algorithm that finds all
repeats that concur with our definition. The time complexity of the algorithm,
when searching for repeats with up to k errors in a string S of length n, is
O(nka log (n/k)) where a is the maximum number of periods in any reported
repeat. We present some experimental results concerning the performance and
sensitivity of our algorithm. The problem of finding repeats within a string is
a computational problem with important applications in the field of molecular
biology. Both exact and inexact repeats occur frequently in the genome, and
certain repeats occurring in the genome are known to be related to diseases in
the human.}

The tools include identifying significant local alignments (utilizing both two-way and three-way alignments), dividing the set of alignments into connected components (signifying repeat families), computing evolutionary distance between repeat family members, constructing minimum spanning trees from the connected components, and visualizing the evolution of the repeat families. Over 7000 families of repetitive sequences were identified. The size of the families ranged from isolated pairs to over 1600 segments of similar sequence. Approximately 12.3\% of the analyzed sequence participates in a repeat element.}

The more a sequence is compressed by the algorithm, the more significant is the property for that sequence. RESULTS: We present a compression algorithm that tests the presence of a particular type of dosDNA (defined ordered sequence-DNA): approximate tandem repeats of small motifs (i.e. of lengths $<$ 4). This algorithm has been experimented with on four yeast chromosomes. The presence of approximate tandem repeats seems to be a uniform structural property of yeast chromosomes.}

Tandem repeats have been shown to cause human disease, may play a variety of regulatory and evolutionary roles and are important laboratory and analytic tools. Extensive knowledge about pattern size, copy number, mutational history, etc. for tandem repeats has been limited by the inability to easily detect them in genomic sequence data. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for finding tandem repeats which works without the need to specify either the pattern or pattern size. We model tandem repeats by percent identity and frequency of indels between adjacent pattern copies and use statistically based recognition criteria. We demonstrate the algorithm's speed and its ability to detect tandem repeats that have undergone extensive mutational change by analyzing four sequences: the human frataxin gene, the human beta T cellreceptor locus sequence and two yeast chromosomes. These sequences range in size from 3 kb up to 700 kb. A World Wide Web server interface atc3.biomath.mssm.edu/trf.html has been established for automated use of the program.}

One of the main aims of such work is to increase our understanding of genome organization and evolution. This requires studies of the locations of regions of similarity. RESULTS: We present here a new tool, ASSIRC ('Accelerated Search for SImilarity Regions in Chromosomes'), for finding regions of similarity in genomic sequences. The method involves three steps: (i) identification of short exact chains of fixed size, called 'seeds', common to both sequences, using hashing functions; (ii) extension of these seeds into putative regions of similarity by a 'random walk' procedure; (iii) final selection of regions of similarity by assessing alignments of the putative sequences. We used simulations to estimate the proportion of regions of similarity not detected for particular region sizes, base identity proportions and seed sizes. This approach can be tailored to the user's specifications. We looked for regions of similarity between two yeast chromosomes (V and IX). The efficiency of the approach was compared to those of conventional programs BLAST and FASTA, by assessing CPU time required and the regions of similarity found for the same data set.
